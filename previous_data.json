Cells were labeled with U-13C-glutamine to determine if overexpressing ZFP36L1 influences the carbon fate of Ad5 infected cells. These cells were simultaneously either mock or adenovirus infected at the same time point. Extractions were performed 24 hrs post tracer and infection treatment. Abby and Francesca are doing a good job."
